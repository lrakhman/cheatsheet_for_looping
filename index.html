    <h1>Looping in Ruby and JavaScript</h1>
    <p>Below is a comparison of the different looping constructs available in Ruby and JavaScript.</p>

    <table border = "1"> <!--remove styling when CSS is added -->
      <tr>
        <th>Looping construct</th>
        <th>Ruby</th>
        <th>JavaScript</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Loop</td>
        <td>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>Ruby has a basic "loop".  An explicit "break" must be added to prevent an infinite loop.</p>

          Example:
          <xmp>i = 20
loop do
  print i
  break if i <= 0
  i -= 1
end
</xmp>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>JavaScript does not have a basic "loop" construct, but the same result can be achieved with a "while(true)" loop.</p>

          Example:
                    <xmp>var i = 20;
while( true ) {
  console.log(i)
  if (i <= 0) {
    break
  }
  i -= 1;
}
</xmp>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>While/Until</td>
        <td>
          <p>Ruby has both a "while" loop and an "until" loop.  Logically, "while(true)" is equivalent to "until(false)".  Below are some examples.</p>

          While example #1:
          <xmp>counter = 1
while counter < 11
  puts counter
  counter += 1
end
</xmp>

Until example #1:
<xmp>counter = 1
until counter > 10
  puts counter
  counter += 1
end
</xmp>

While example #2:
<xmp>i = 0
num = 5
begin
   puts("Inside the loop i = #{i}" )
   i +=1
end while i <= num
</xmp>


Until example #2:
<xmp>i = 0
num = 5
begin
   puts("Inside the loop i = #{i}" )
   i +=1;
end until i > num
</xmp>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>JavaScript has a "while" loop but no "until" loop.  However, "until" is logically equivalent to "while(false)", so "until" loops can easily be imitated in JavaScript.</p>

          While example #1:
          <xmp>var counter = 1
while (counter < 11) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter += 1;
}
          </xmp>

          While example #2:
          <xmp>var i = 0;
var num = 5;
do {
  console.log("Inside the loop i = " + i);
  i += 1;
} while (i <= num);
          </xmp>


          <!-- Note: I included different examples so the code would do the same thing as the examples in the Ruby section.  Thoughts?
          <xmp>
          var loops = 0

          var loop = function(){
            while(loops < 3){
            console.log("Look at me, I'm looping!")
            loops++;  
              
            }
          };

          loop();
          </xmp>

          Do...while:
          <xmp>
          do {
             i += 1;
             document.write(i);
          } while (i < 5); 

        </xmp> -->
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>For</td>
        <td>
          <p>Ruby has a basic "for" loop that is used with collections (ranges, array, hashes).</p>
          For example:
          <xmp>for num in 1..20
  puts num
end
</xmp>

<!-- In this case, I think either example is fine, but we don't need both.
((((((or))))))

<xmp>
friends = [:cat, :dog, :mouse, :zebra, :elephant]

for i in friends
  puts "I love my #{i}"
end
</xmp> -->
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>JavaScript has two types of "for" loops: a basic "for" loop with collections, like Ruby's "for" loop, and a "for...in" loop that is used to loop through properties of objects.</p>
            For example:
            <xmp>for (var num = 1; num < 21; i++) {
    console.log(num);
}
            </xmp>

            For...in example:

            <xmp>var myObj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}, myKeys = [];
             
for (var property in myObj) {
    myKeys.push(property);
}
 
myKeys; //['a','b','c']; 
            </xmp><!-- do we need the second part of the last line? -->

<!-- (((Or we could use this example for the for/in loop instead:))) => I like the above example better because it's simpler, which allows the reader to focus on the actual looping construct.  If you agree, delete this comment and its contents.

<xmp>
  var arr = ['a','b','c'], indexes = [];
Array.prototype.each = function() {/*blah*/};
 
for (var index in arr) {
    if (arr.hasOwnProperty(index)) {
        indexes.push(index);
    }   
}
 
indexes; //["0", "1", "2"]
